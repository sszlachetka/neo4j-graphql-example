## Neo4j

Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for applications. In Neo4j, information is organized as nodes, relationships, and properties.

It turns out that "relational" databases handle relationships poorly. In a graph database, there are no JOINs or lookups. Relationships are stored natively alongside the data elements (the nodes) in a much more flexible format.

### Cypher

Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s graph query language that allows to store and retrieve data from the graph database.

Vocabulary:
- Node - data entity
- Node label - allow to specify certain types of entities to look for or create
- Relationship - directed connection between two nodes
- Relationship type - categorize and add meaning to a relationship, similar to how labels group nodes
- Property - key-value pair property can be stored on both nodes and relationships

[Node or relationship properties](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/cypher-intro/#cypher-properties)

Sally likes Graphs
```
(p:Person {name: "Sally"})-[rel:LIKES]->(g:Technology {type: "Graphs"})
```

## TODO
1. Why import hints doesn't work in test/
2. Use absolute import paths?
